1.Save the code as a Java file (e.g., WordFrequency.java).
2.Compile the Java file using the following command or use eclipse to generate jar file:
javac -cp pig.jar WordFrequency.java

where pig.jar is the Pig library. 
3. Register the UDF in your Pig script using the following command:

REGISTER 'WordFrequency.jar';
DEFINE WordFrequency WordFrequency();

where WordFrequency.jar is the compiled Java file. 
4. Use the UDF in your Pig script as follows:

A = LOAD 'Documents/Shakespeare.txt' AS (line:chararray);
B = FOREACH A GENERATE WordFrequency(line);
DUMP B;

where input.txt is your input text document.
